# HisabClub — Complete Project Knowledge Transfer

## What is HisabClub?

A **privacy-first, self-hosted Indian personal finance ledger**. Users upload bank/credit-card statements and tax-supporting documents (`.pdf`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv`), optionally sync Android SMS transaction alerts, and the app merges all sources into a unified ledger with automatic categorization, spending insights, bill tracking, and tax/audit assessment.

**Core differentiators:**
- Indian bank statement expertise (HDFC, Axis, SBI parsers)
- Password-protected PDF handling (pikepdf decryption)
- Mixed-format local document intake for tax/demat artifacts (`pdf/xlsx/xls/csv`)
- Cross-source reconciliation (statement + SMS dedup)
- Self-hosted (all data stays on your server)
- Deterministic core logic, LLM only as feature-flagged fallback
- Privacy-first: OTPs and personal messages never leave the device

## Current Supported Runtime

This is the verified development/runtime topology as of 2026-04-07:

- **Backend** runs on the host at `http://localhost:8356`
- **Web frontend** is built to `frontend/dist` and served by the backend at `/`
- **PostgreSQL** and **Redis** run in Docker
- **Primary local LLM** now runs outside this repo from `/home/ankit/Documents/local-llm` at `http://localhost:8096/v1`
  - active model: `Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf`
- **Legacy text endpoint on `:8472` is no longer the active application path**
- **Optional local OCR/vision endpoint** can run outside this repo from `/home/ankit/Documents/local-llm` at `http://localhost:8095/v1`
- **Optional dedicated vision extraction endpoint** can be configured separately for page-image parsing (for example `Qwen3-VL-8B` served from a local OpenAI-compatible `/v1` endpoint)
- **Local document knowledge** is stored in PostgreSQL and populated from uploads, folder intake, and backfill
- **Expo Metro** runs on the host at `http://localhost:8081` for mobile debug
- **Physical Android devices** connect through `adb reverse` for `8356` and `8081`
- **Permanent dev API domain** defaults to `https://hisabclub-dev-api.ankit-tech.store/api/v1`
- **Permanent dev web domain** defaults to `https://hisabclub-dev-web.ankit-tech.store`
- **Recommended public tunnel target for both API and web** is the host backend on `http://192.168.1.69:8356`
- **Vite on `:5276`** is optional local-only hot reload and should not be the stable public web origin

The Docker `api` service is not the primary supported path right now. The supported path is host backend + Docker db/redis + host LLM.

  - transactions screen selection mode for bulk updates
  - transaction detail screen with category/nature/notes/tags/exclude editing
  - transaction split creation on mobile

  - navigation wiring for the above through root stack + settings quick access
  - authenticated PDF download to local cache + system share/open flow for statement review
- Mobile login now uses real `/auth/register` for account creation instead of first-user-only `/auth/setup`.
- `GET /api/v1/accounts/tree` UUID serialization bug is fixed.
- `POST /api/v1/conversations/{thread_id}/resolve` async refresh bug is fixed.
- Main navigation now surfaces assistant pending-question count.
- Upload API now accepts `pdf/xlsx/xls/csv`:
  - statement parsing remains PDF-first
  - spreadsheet/CSV uploads are stored as `document_artifacts` and routed through tax/demat classification
- Parser now supports selective OCR fallback for scanned or low-signal PDFs:
  - native text extraction runs first
  - only empty/low-signal pages are rendered and sent to a local OpenAI-compatible vision endpoint
  - OCR output is merged back into the page stream before parser/LLM extraction
- Upload and folder-import flows now ingest decrypted PDF text into `document_knowledge_chunks`.
- Statement parsing builds same-user context from prior chunks and prior parsed statements before LLM classification or fallback extraction.
- Local LLM access is now routed by task rather than hardwired:
  - text extraction/classification/review use the shared text route
  - OCR transcription uses the OCR route
  - optional page-image statement extraction can use a separate vision route
- Statement extraction now runs a post-parse validation pass that drops duplicate rows, invalid amounts/directions, and implausible out-of-range dates before persistence/promotion.
- Backend now supports optional vision-first fallback extraction from rendered PDF pages:
  - disabled by default
  - intended for dedicated local models such as `Qwen3-VL-8B`
  - invoked before text-only fallback when enabled for hard/low-signal statements
- Backend now also supports **primary** vision-led PDF-to-JSON extraction:
  - enabled only when `LLM_VISION_STATEMENT_PRIMARY=true`
  - rendered statement pages are sent to the dedicated local vision route before template parsing
  - template/text extraction remain as fallback for resilience
- Vision extraction confidence defaults were raised for rows where the model omits explicit `confidence`, preventing good rows from being quarantined by default.
- Folder import now commits incrementally:
  - artifacts and parsed statements become visible during long imports
  - request-scoped tenant context is re-applied after commit to satisfy RLS
  - knowledge ingestion now commits before the expensive statement parse begins, reducing long `idle in transaction` windows
- Real-directory validation against `/home/ankit/Documents/FY24-25-Ankit-details` now confirms successful `Qwen3-VL` parsing for:
  - `0206-statement.pdf` -> `BOB savings`, `13` transactions
  - `ANKIT-HDFC-CC-STATEMENT.pdf` -> `HDFC credit_card`, `66` transactions
  - `9719-statement.pdf` -> `ICICI savings`, `186` transactions
  - all three promoted cleanly with `parser_used=llm_vision_page_extract`
- PostgreSQL remains the source of truth; no NoSQL replacement is planned for the ledger/review/audit path.
- Savings/current statements now run a deterministic balance-walk check:
  - `opening_balance + credits - debits ~= closing_balance`
  - mismatches are stored in `statement.parse_errors.validation.balance_walk`
  - worker promotion gates can force such statements into `review_required`
- Bank inference now prefers statement-header matches over incidental bank names inside transaction descriptions.
- Classifier false positives were reduced:
  - short tokens like `cas` are word-boundary matched (so `cash` no longer triggers demat by mistake)
  - generic `interest` no longer auto-forces `interest_certificate` without certificate cues
- Upload review notifications now have a persistent backend feed at `GET /api/v1/upload/recent`.
- Statements can now be deleted with full local cleanup, including `raw_pdfs`, stored PDF files, and `document_knowledge_chunks`.
- Statements can now be re-reviewed through the local LLM using the stored PDF as the source of truth.
- Existing PDFs can be reindexed into the local knowledge store with `make backfill-knowledge`.
- Canonical promotion now runs atomically inside a DB savepoint so partial failures cannot leave orphaned ledger rows.
- Statement ingestion now computes semantic statement fingerprints and blocks accidental duplicate statement insertion unless reprocess is explicitly allowed.
- File dedup is content-hash based (`SHA-256`) per user:
  - same-content files with different names are treated as duplicates
  - duplicate response now includes the matched prior file name
- Transaction dedup now has a deterministic fingerprint path (`user + account + date + abs(amount) + normalized description prefix`) in addition to fuzzy matching.
- Transaction dedup is now account-aware in fingerprint, exact-reference, and fuzzy amount/date matching paths.
- LLM sanitization now preserves operational transaction references such as `UPI/UTR/IMPS/NEFT/RTGS` IDs while still masking explicit account/card identifiers.
- Credit-card integrity review now excludes quarantined rows and uses structured JSON parsing instead of free-form parsing.
- OCR backend path is code-complete but not operationally active until OCR model artifacts are added under `/home/ankit/Documents/local-llm/models`.
- Merchant normalization now caches merchant patterns in-process during promotion to reduce repeated full-table scans.
- Transfer/card-payment pairing now persists auditable matches in `transfer_matches`.
- Gmail OAuth credentials are now encrypted at rest and remain backward-compatible with previously stored plaintext rows.
- Tax & Audit web page now uses Financial Year selection:
  - Running FY + previous 5 FYs
  - auto-refresh on FY change with optional manual refresh buttons

## 2026-03-30 Architecture-Update Implementation

- Statement ingestion is now **durable and queue-first**:
  - `upload/pdf` creates `raw_pdfs` + `extraction_jobs`, then returns `reviewing`
  - worker loop claims jobs from PostgreSQL with retry/backoff and DLQ state
  - upload status/recent endpoints now surface job state even before statement materialization
- Added operational APIs for ingestion reliability:
  - `GET /api/v1/upload/jobs/dlq`
  - `POST /api/v1/upload/jobs/{job_id}/requeue`
  - `GET /api/v1/upload/parser-health`
- Added institution password-pattern registry and resolver:
  - model: `institution_password_patterns`
  - APIs: list/upsert/delete under `/api/v1/gmail/password-patterns`
  - used by manual upload, Gmail sync, and statement re-review for encrypted PDFs
- Gmail sync now enqueues parse jobs instead of parsing attachments inline.
- Parser observability now updates `institution_parser_support` success/failure counters from worker outcomes.
- Added DB-level tenant isolation migrations:
  - RLS policies + FORCE RLS on user-scoped tables
  - request context via `app.current_user_id`
  - worker bypass via `app.worker_mode=1`
- Added runtime DB-role switch (`SET ROLE hisabclub_rls`) in API/worker sessions so RLS remains effective even if the bootstrap user has elevated privileges.

## 2026-03-30 Phase 2 Implementation (Architecture-Update)

- LLM orchestration upgraded for long-statement reliability:
  - iterative chunk extraction in `app/engines/llm/parse_fallback.py`
  - prompt templates and few-shot bank examples in `app/engines/llm/prompts.py`
  - deterministic model-routing hooks in `app/engines/llm/router.py`
  - JSON-structured response support in `LLMClient.chat_json()`
- Added extraction quality controls and partial promotion:
  - `PROMOTION_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` now gates canonical promotion
  - low-confidence rows are stored as quarantined `parsed_transactions`
  - `review_tasks` table added with APIs:
    - `GET /api/v1/reviews/tasks`
    - `POST /api/v1/reviews/tasks/{task_id}/resolve`
  - statement-level quality metrics added:
    - `expected_row_count`, `extracted_row_count`, `promoted_row_count`, `quarantined_row_count`, `yield_rate`
- Added yield-rate observability:
  - parser pre-estimate via `estimate_expected_transaction_rows()`
  - parser-health now reports expected/extracted rows and yield-rate per bank/account type
- Added UPI failed-payment reconciliation:
  - engine: `app/engines/ledger/upi_reconciliation.py`
  - API: `POST /api/v1/transactions/reconcile-upi-failures`
  - auto-run after statement parse jobs
- Added queue fairness and storage tiering:
  - per-user fair job selection in `claim_next_job()` (prevents one-user starvation)
  - hot→cold PDF movement in `app/engines/storage/tiering.py`
  - `raw_pdfs` now tracks `storage_tier` and `cold_storage_path`
- Migration `f9a0b1c2d3e4` applied successfully and is the current DB head.

## 2026-03-30 Remaining Gap Closure (Architecture-Update Completion)

- Added **cross-page table stitching path** via `extract_stitched_table_rows()` and wired it into statement parsing before LLM fallback.
- Added **tier-2 extraction path** in `llm_parse_statement()`:
  - deterministic table rows
  - LLM column mapping only
  - deterministic row-to-transaction mapping
  - fallback to iterative full extraction if mapping is insufficient
- Added **post-parse multi-gate escalation** in worker:
  - quarantine gate
  - yield-rate gate (`MIN_YIELD_RATE_FOR_AUTO_PROMOTION`)
  - optional credit-card integrity gate (`REQUIRE_CC_INTEGRITY_OK_FOR_AUTO_PROMOTION`)
- Added local **POC/eval scripts** under `scripts/`:
  - `poc_table_stitch_eval.py`
  - `poc_llm_column_mapping_eval.py`
  - `poc_ocr_compare.py`
- Verified the POC scripts execute locally with `backend/.venv/bin/python ...` and report JSON output.

## Statement Parsers (6 registered)

| Parser ID | Bank | Type | Key Format Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hdfc_cc_v1` | HDFC | credit_card | `C` prefix for amounts (₹→C artifact), `+` for credits, `DD/MM/YYYY\| HH:MM` dates, `l` PI indicator at end |
| `hdfc_savings_v1` | HDFC | savings | 3-amount (withdrawal/deposit/balance), 2-amount, labelled (Cr/Dr) patterns |
| `axis_cc_v1` | AXIS | credit_card | Standard DD/MM/YYYY + Amount + Cr/Dr |
| `axis_savings_v1` | AXIS | savings | Same multi-pattern approach as HDFC savings |
| `sbi_cc_v1` | SBI | credit_card | SBI Card format |
| `sbi_savings_v1` | SBI | savings | Handles 2-date format (Txn Date + Value Date) |

### Parser Pipeline
```
PDF bytes + password → pikepdf decrypt → pdfplumber extract text → detect parser →
  template parse → [if 0 txns + LLM enabled → LLM fallback] → save Statement →
  for each txn: create ParsedTransaction → promote_to_canonical (with dedup) →
  auto-create Bill if due_date present
```

### Adding a New Bank Parser
1. Create `backend/app/engines/parser/templates/<bank>_<type>.py`
2. Implement `StatementParser` ABC: `parser_id`, `bank_name`, `account_type`, `detect()`, `parse()`
3. Call `register_parser(YourParser())` at module level
4. Add import to `_ensure_parsers_loaded()` in `backend/app/engines/parser/base.py`

## SMS Processing (On-Device, Android Only)

### Pipeline (privacy-first — raw SMS never leaves device)
```
Native Module reads inbox → filter by known sender IDs → classify →
  [OTPs/promos/spam discarded] → parse transaction details →
  POST /api/v1/sms/batch (only parsed data, not raw SMS)
```

### Key Design Decisions
- **Account reference required**: SMS must contain `a/c XX1234` or similar to be classified as transaction (prevents promo spam like "Get Rs.6,000 Cashback")
- **Sender ID format**: Handles `XX-BANKID` and `XX-BANKID-X` (e.g., `AD-ICICIT-S` → ICICI)
- **30+ known sender IDs**: HDFC, ICICI, AXIS, SBI, Kotak, PNB, IndusInd, Yes, IDFC, + wallets (Paytm, PhonePe)
- **PermissionsAndroid.request()** for system permission dialog (not native module)

### After `expo prebuild`
The `android/` directory is regenerated. You MUST:
1. Re-copy Kotlin files: `cp src/modules/sms-reader/android/*.kt android/app/src/main/java/com/hisabclub/app/smsreader/`
2. Re-add to MainApplication.kt: `import com.hisabclub.app.smsreader.SmsReaderPackage` and `add(SmsReaderPackage())` in packages list

## LLM Configuration

### Shared Local LLM Runtime
```bash
cd /home/ankit/Documents/local-llm
./llama-turbo-cuda.sh start
```

### Model Details
- **File**: `/home/ankit/Documents/local-llm/models/unsloth-Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-GGUF/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf`
- **Model**: Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct, Q4_K_M quantization
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX A5000 (24GB VRAM)
- **Primary API**: OpenAI-compatible at `http://localhost:8096/v1`
- **OCR API**: OpenAI-compatible at `http://localhost:8095/v1`
- **Ownership**: model runtime is managed in `/home/ankit/Documents/local-llm`, not in this repo

### LLM Usage in App
- **Feature-flagged**: `LLM_ENABLED=true` in `.env`
- **Primary statement extraction**: `Qwen3-VL` page-image parsing for supported PDF statement flows
- **Fallback for 0-transaction parsing**: deterministic/text fallback remains available when vision extraction is insufficient
- **Merchant normalization**: Clean up messy raw merchant descriptions
- **Category suggestion**: Pick best category from list
- **PII sanitized** before any LLM call (cards, names, PAN, Aadhaar, OTPs stripped)
- **Qwen local runtime**: requests set `chat_template_kwargs.enable_thinking=false` so local llama.cpp returns usable `message.content`

## Build & Deploy Commands

### Recommended local workflow
```bash
make setup
make local-stack
make local-check
```

`make local-stack` is the supported entrypoint. It starts Docker db/redis, ensures the shared local LLM is up, builds the frontend, applies migrations, seeds categories/merchants, and runs the backend on the host.

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
.venv/bin/uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8356 --log-level info   # Start
.venv/bin/alembic upgrade head                                                  # Apply migrations
.venv/bin/alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"                     # New migration
.venv/bin/python -m app.seed.run                                               # Seed categories + merchants
```

### Web Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev           # Dev server on :5276 when needed
npm run build         # Build to dist/ (served by backend at /)
```

### Mobile APK
```bash
cd mobile
npx expo prebuild --platform android --clean   # Generate android/ (WIPES customizations!)

# Re-apply native module:
mkdir -p android/app/src/main/java/com/hisabclub/app/smsreader
cp src/modules/sms-reader/android/*.kt android/app/src/main/java/com/hisabclub/app/smsreader/
# Edit android/app/src/main/java/com/hisabclub/app/MainApplication.kt:
#   Add import: com.hisabclub.app.smsreader.SmsReaderPackage
#   Add to packages: add(SmsReaderPackage())

# Build:
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64
export ANDROID_HOME=~/android-sdk
cd android && ./gradlew assembleRelease
# APK at: android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk

# Install via ADB:
/usr/bin/adb push <apk-path> /data/local/tmp/hisabclub.apk
/usr/bin/adb shell pm install -r /data/local/tmp/hisabclub.apk
/usr/bin/adb shell am start -n com.hisabclub.app/.MainActivity
```

### Debug mobile against local backend
```bash
make android-install
make mobile-dev
```

This applies `adb reverse` for `8356` and `8081`, then starts Metro for the dev client.

### Docker Services
```bash
docker compose up -d                 # Start PostgreSQL + Redis
docker compose down                  # Stop
```

## Rules for Updating the Codebase

### Adding a New Model
1. Create file in `backend/app/models/<name>.py`
2. Add import to `backend/app/models/__init__.py` (both import and `__all__`)
3. Add import to `backend/alembic/env.py`
4. Run: `.venv/bin/alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add <name> table"`
5. Apply: `.venv/bin/alembic upgrade head`

### Adding a New API Endpoint
1. Create file in `backend/app/api/v1/<name>.py`
2. Add router import + `include_router()` to `backend/app/api/v1/router.py`
3. Add Pydantic schemas to `backend/app/schemas/<name>.py`
4. Use `CurrentUser` and `DbSession` from `app.dependencies`

### Adding a New Web Page
1. Create `frontend/src/pages/<Name>Page.tsx`
2. Add route in `frontend/src/App.tsx`
3. Add nav item in `frontend/src/components/Layout.tsx`
4. Add API methods/types to `frontend/src/api/client.ts`
5. Rebuild: `npx vite build`

### Adding a New Mobile Screen
1. Create `mobile/src/screens/<Name>Screen.tsx`
2. Add to navigation types in `mobile/src/navigation/types.ts`
3. Add to `RootNavigator.tsx` or `MainTabs.tsx`
4. Add API methods to `mobile/src/api/client.ts` and types to `types.ts`

### Important: API Response Format
- List endpoints return `{items: [...], total: N}` — frontends must unwrap `.items`
- Mobile API client functions already unwrap for `getBills()` and `getBudgets()`
- Web API client also unwraps for these

## Current Gaps / Operational Notes

1. **Parser coverage is now mixed deterministic + vision-first** — real validation is complete for BOB savings, HDFC credit card, and ICICI savings using `llm_vision_page_extract`. Remaining long-tail formats still need more parser tuning.
2. **Gmail OAuth is not usable until credentials are configured** — `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` and `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` are empty by default.
3. **Docker API runtime is not the recommended path** — the verified topology is host backend + Docker db/redis + host LLM.
4. **Expo prebuild still wipes native Android customizations** — after `expo prebuild --clean`, the SMS reader Kotlin files and `MainApplication.kt` integration must be restored.
5. **Expo debug loader can emit a non-fatal startup warning** — during Metro handoff on device, a dev-only loading popup warning may appear even though the app stays alive.
6. **Redis is present but lightly used** — there is no full background worker pipeline yet.
7. **Frontend bundle is large** — the production build currently reports a Vite chunk-size warning, but it builds and runs correctly.
8. **Large recursive folder imports are now incremental** — artifacts/statements become visible during the run instead of only at the final commit.

## Verified State (2026-04-06)

- Backend health endpoint returns OK
- Primary local vision LLM responds on `:8096`
- Local OCR model responds on `:8095`
- Frontend production build succeeds
- Targeted backend tests for the new importer + vision stack pass: `12 passed`
- Seeded categories are available after login: `73`
- Web frontend renders through the backend-served SPA
- Real dataset validation succeeded for:
  - `0206-statement.pdf` -> `BOB savings` -> `13` rows
  - `ANKIT-HDFC-CC-STATEMENT.pdf` -> `HDFC credit_card` -> `66` rows
  - `9719-statement.pdf` -> `ICICI savings` -> `186` rows

## What Was Built (Session History)

### Phase 1: MVP
- Project scaffolding, Docker Compose, pyproject.toml, Makefile
- All 18 database models + Alembic migrations
- FastAPI app with auth (JWT + Argon2)
- Statement parser engine with 3 CC parsers (HDFC, Axis, SBI)
- Ledger engine (promote parsed → canonical + merchant matching)
- 73 categories + 48 merchants seeded
- Web frontend: Login, Dashboard, Upload, Transactions, Statements
- All verified working with curl tests

### Phase 2: Mobile App
- Expo React Native project with full UI
- 11 screens matching web features
- Custom Kotlin SMS reader native module
- On-device SMS parsing + spam filtering
- Backend SMS batch endpoint
- APK built and installed via ADB

### Phase 3: Production Features
- **Insights engine**: monthly summaries, category breakdown, trends, recurring detection
- **Budget tracker**: per-category budgets with real-time spent calculation
- **Bill tracker**: auto-created from CC statements, due date tracking
- **CSV export**: streaming download
- **LLM integration**: client, PII sanitizer, parse fallback, merchant cleanup, categorizer
- **Gmail integration**: OAuth, sender allowlist, sync
- **Cross-source dedup**: 3-tier (exact ref → fuzzy → window)
- **Web frontend upgrade**: Insights/Budgets/Bills/Gmail pages, dashboard charts
- **Mobile upgrade**: Insights/Budgets/Bills screens, enhanced dashboard

### Phase 4: Bug Fixes
- Fixed HDFC CC parser for real Swiggy HDFC card format (C prefix, + credits, DATE|TIME)
- Fixed SMS spam filter (require account reference, handle XX-BANKID-X format)
- Fixed mobile crash on signup (empty bills/budgets response handling)
- Fixed API client getBills/getBudgets unwrapping {items} response
- Fixed bills endpoint to accept `?status=upcoming`
- Added savings account parsers (HDFC, Axis, SBI)
- Added LLM fallback when template returns 0 transactions
- Fixed web UI serving via Cloudflare tunnel (static files from backend)
- Fixed password manager autofill on LoginScreen
- Added debug text saving for PDF uploads

## Future Plan & Goals

### Short-term (Next Sprint)
1. **Broaden parser coverage** — Add Kotak, ICICI, BOB, and other common Indian statement formats
2. **Increase ingestion confidence** — Expand tests around folder intake, unsupported-bank routing, and LLM fallback
3. **Test SMS on real device with live messages** — Verify native module classification against actual bank senders
4. **Harden transfer intelligence** — Improve CC payment matching and statement-total reconciliation
5. **Create the initial clean commit history** — The working tree is still pre-history and should be committed intentionally

### Medium-term
6. **Gmail OAuth setup** — Google Cloud Console, OAuth consent screen, restricted scope verification
7. **OCR fallback** — Selective low-signal page OCR is implemented; remaining work is model benchmarking on weak public-sector scans
8. **User correction learning** — When user edits merchant/category, auto-apply to future matches
9. **Multi-user auth** — Proper registration flow, password reset, email verification
10. **Family mode** — Merge spouse/family cards into shared dashboard

### Long-term
11. **Account Aggregator integration** — India's AA ecosystem (Sahamati) for direct bank data
12. **Rewards tracking** — Credit card reward points from statements
13. **Encryption at rest** — AES-256 for stored PDFs, encrypted DB columns for sensitive data
14. **Zero-retention mode** — Delete PDFs after parsing, keep only structured data
15. **iOS support** — Expo build for iOS (no SMS, but all other features)
16. **Play Store distribution** — Apply for SMS permission exception or use SMS Retriever API
17. **Automated backups** — PostgreSQL pg_dump on schedule
18. **Notification system** — Bill due date reminders, unusual spending alerts
19. **PWA** — Offline-capable web app with service worker
20. **Import from other apps** — CSV import from Walnut, Axio, Money Manager
21. **API rate limiting** — Production hardening
22. **Audit logging** — Track all data access for compliance

### Product Direction
- **Statement-first, not SMS-first** — Statements are the source of truth
- **Self-hosted, not cloud** — User owns all data
- **India-specific** — Don't try to be generic, go deep on Indian banks
- **Deterministic core** — LLM is always a fallback, never the primary logic
- **Privacy by design** — OTPs never transmitted, PII sanitized before LLM, zero-retention option
